Gravitational Wave Analysis
This is a program that can measure and model the gravitational waves emitted by massive objects in space using general relativity, differential geometry, and signal processing. The program can also use Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the parameters and uncertainties of the source from the detector data, and to compare different models and hypotheses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
The program requires the following Python libraries to run:

numpy
scipy
matplotlib
pycbc
emcee
corner

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can install these libraries using pip or conda commands. For example:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pycbc emcee corner

or

conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pycbc emcee corner

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
The program consists of a single Python script called gravitational_wave_analysis.py. You can run the program from the command line by typing:

python gravitational_wave_analysis.py

The program will load the detector data from two detectors: LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston, using the pycbc library. The data segment corresponds to the GW150914 event, which was the first direct detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger. The program will then generate the gravitational waveform model using the pycbc library, based on some initial guess for the model parameters. The program will then calculate the log likelihood of the data given the model, and the log prior of the model parameters, using uniform distributions. The program will then use the emcee library to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the posterior distributions of the model parameters, using Bayesâ€™ theorem. The program will then use the corner library to plot the posterior distributions of the model parameters, and show the mean and standard deviation values for each parameter.

The program will also produce some plots that show the gravitational waveform, the detector response before and after filtering, and the match filter between the filtered signal and the template signal. These plots can help to visualize and understand the results of the program.

Output
The program will output the following files in the current directory:

gravitational_waveform.png: A plot of the gravitational waveform of the binary system, showing the plus and cross polarizations.
detector_response.png: A plot of the detector response before and after filtering, showing the noisy and filtered signals.
match_filter.png: A plot of the match filter between the filtered signal and the template signal, showing the time shift and the signal-to-noise ratio.
posterior_distributions.png: A corner plot of the posterior distributions of the model parameters, showing the mean and standard deviation values for each parameter.
